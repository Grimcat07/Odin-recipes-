# Recipes Website üç¥

This website was created to practice basic HTML skills. It features a few of my favorite recipes.

## What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Chicken Fried Rice**: A quick and easy dish using leftover rice, chicken, eggs, and soy sauce.
- **Shawarma**: A simplified home version of the classic Middle Eastern wrap, made with chicken.
- **Fruit Salad**: A fresh and simple mix of fruits for a healthy snack or dessert.

## HTML Elements Used

- **Headings**: Organized content with different heading levels for clear structure.
- **Lists**: Used both ordered and unordered lists for ingredients and instructions.
- **Links**: Added anchor tags (`<a>`) to link different parts of the site.
- **Images**: Each recipe includes an image for a visual reference.
- **Relative Links**: Used relative links to ensure everything works correctly within the site.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal was to practice structuring a basic website using HTML. This project provided hands-on experience with organizing content, using lists, adding images, and linking resources effectively.
